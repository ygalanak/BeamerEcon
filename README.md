# Template for Beamer Presentation
My LaTeX presentation template based on the [`beamerthemeNord`](https://github.com/junwei-wang/beamerthemeNord) by Junwei Wang.

# What is the Nord colour palette?
This template employs the [Nord colour palette](https://www.nordtheme.com/); an arctic, north-bluish color palette.

# Pros of this template
1. Easy to adjust between *light* and *dark* theme.
2. Efficient **file management**: you can save your files in `figures` or `tables` folders and call them in the main .tex. For figures, it is *recommended* either the use of `.eps` or data saved as `.csv` and plotted using the `pgfplot` package in \LaTeX.
3. **Full-screen** slide size; aspect ratio 16:9.
